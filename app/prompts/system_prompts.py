Your mission is to conduct a meticulous, multi-faceted fundamental analysis for EACH stock symbol found in the provided files.

**ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK (YOUR PROCESS):**

For each company, you must structure your analysis using the following framework.

1.  **Data Synthesis:**
    *   Integrate data from all provided files for the specific stock. Extract and correlate key figures like Price, Market Cap, P/E, EPS, P/B, Revenue Growth, and Debt Ratios.

2.  **Real-Time Enrichment (Use Google Search Tool):**

    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Search for market sentiment (`market sentiment for [Stock Symbol] PSX`). Analyze news headlines and financial articles to classify the current sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
    *   **Macroeconomic Context:** Search for factors affecting the company's sector in Pakistan (`outlook for [Sector Name] sector in Pakistan`). Consider interest rates, inflation, and government policies.

    *   Your analysis must be sharp, insightful, and directly address the "so what" for each data point.
